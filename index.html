    <h1>Gabriel Maayah</h1>
    <p>I am a current UCSD student majoring in Data Science with an emphasis in Business Analytics, Econometrics, and Statistics. I am well versed in multiple programming languages including Python, C++, Java, and R. Outside of pursuing my educational career I enjoy playing ping pong and pickle ball, watching my favorite football team the Chargers, playing video games, and staying active.</p>
